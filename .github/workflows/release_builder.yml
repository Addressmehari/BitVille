          ## Features
          ### Activity Tracking:
          * **Active Time**: Tracks your keyboard and mouse usage to build houses.
          * **Idle Time**: Tracks breaks to plant trees.
          * **Keystrokes**: Counts key presses to unlock house upgrades (terraces).
          * **GitHub Integration**: Monitors your GitHub contributions to build special "Git Post" buildings.

          ### City Visualizer:
          * Real-time isometric rendering of your city.
          * Dynamic Day/Night cycle synchronized with local time.
          * "Construction Mode" showing progress bars for the next building/upgrade.
          * Zoom and Pan controls.

          ### Sticky Notes (Glass Input):
          * A floating, always-on-top window for quick note-taking.
          * **Sticky Notes Wall**: A dedicated view to visualize your saved notes as sticky notes on a virtual wall.

          ### System Tray Application:
          * Minimize to tray for unobtrusive background operation.
          * Quick access menu to open the visualizer, settings, or statistics.

          ### Settings:
          * Configurable thresholds for all rewards (House, Tree, Upgrade, Git Post).
          * Customizable GitHub username.

          ## 📦 Installation
          1. Extract the release ZIP to a dedicated folder.
          2. Run `GitVille.exe`.
             > **Important**: Do not delete the `datas/` folder or `settings.json` generated by the app, as they contain your city's save data.
